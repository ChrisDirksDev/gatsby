Between serving as a  Front-End developer at HiringThing, a Server Application developer at Selectron Technologies, and pursuing individual development projects and interests; I have been able to greatly increase my knowledge of various software technologies including ReactJS, Javascript(ES6), TypeScript, Redux, and SASS. This has led me to want to focus on further Front-End Web Development roles."
